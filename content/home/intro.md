ðŸ‘‹ Hi, there! I'm **Lily Cothren**, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering at the University of Colorado, Boulder under the supervision of Professor Emiliano Dallâ€™Anese. I'm excited to continue my research as a Fellow for the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF GRFP) starting in the fall of 2023.
